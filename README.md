### General Info
This project was my first poroject using the canvas html element. I used the mouse events to target the offets of the e.target, and create circles with the drawCircle method that when 
repeated and used with drawLine looked like a solid line. I created an incrementor and decrementor button to adjust the size of my line, and this was also the first time I used the color input as well. I will need to create my own canvases and practice to get a good grasp on using it.
